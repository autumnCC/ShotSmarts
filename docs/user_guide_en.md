## Parameter Explanations

### Input Parameters

- **Light Conditions**: Describes the lighting situation of the shooting environment.
  - Sunny: Abundant, bright sunlight
  - Cloudy: Partial cloud cover blocking sunlight
  - Overcast: Completely covered by clouds, soft light
  - Night: Little or no natural light
  - Indoor: Indoor lighting conditions

- **ISO**: Indicates the camera sensor's sensitivity to light.
  - Low ISO values (100-400): Sufficient light environments, produces less noise
  - Medium ISO values (400-800): General lighting environments
  - High ISO values (800-3200): Low light environments, may produce more noise

- **Scene Mode**: Optimized settings for specific shooting subjects.
  - Sports: Prioritizes shutter speed to capture fast-moving subjects
  - Portrait: Prioritizes large apertures to create soft background blur
  - Landscape: Prioritizes small apertures for greater depth of field
  - Macro: Suitable for close-up shooting of small objects
  - Night: Optimizes parameters for night shooting

### Output Parameters

- **Aperture (f-value)**: Controls the amount of light entering the lens and depth of field.
  - Small f-values (e.g., f/1.4): Large aperture, shallow depth of field, blurred background
  - Large f-values (e.g., f/16): Small aperture, large depth of field, everything in focus

- **Shutter Speed**: Controls the length of time light exposes the sensor.
  - Fast shutter (e.g., 1/1000 sec): Freezes motion
  - Slow shutter (e.g., 1/30 sec): May require a tripod to avoid camera shake

- **Metering Mode**: How the camera measures scene brightness.
  - Evaluative: Measures the average of the entire frame
  - Center-weighted: Emphasizes the central area of the frame
  - Spot: Measures only a specific point in the frame

- **Exposure Compensation**: Manually adjusts the camera's automatic metering results.
  - Positive values: Makes the image brighter
  - Negative values: Makes the image darker

## Usage Tips

1. **Prioritize Scene Mode**: First select the type of scene you want to shoot, then make minor adjustments based on actual lighting conditions.
2. **Save Common Settings**: Save parameters for commonly encountered shooting environments for quick application in similar situations.
3. **Record Shooting Effects**: Add notes in your parameter records to document the effects achieved using those parameters, which helps build experience.
4. **Balance ISO Adjustments**: In low light conditions, moderately increasing ISO can achieve faster shutter speeds but will increase noise. Balance clarity and noise to choose the appropriate ISO value.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if my camera doesn't have exact matches for the recommended parameters?**  
A: Choose the closest values. ShotSmarts provides reference values that may require slight adjustments based on your camera model.

**Q: Why do different scene modes give significantly different parameters under the same lighting conditions?**  
A: This is because different scene modes prioritize different shooting elements. For example, Sports mode prioritizes shutter speed, while Portrait mode prioritizes aperture size.

**Q: Should I always follow the parameters recommended by the app?**  
A: Recommended parameters are calculated based on photographic theory and practical experience, suitable for most situations. However, photography is also a creative expression, so you can use the recommended parameters as a starting point and then adjust according to your personal style and creative intent.
